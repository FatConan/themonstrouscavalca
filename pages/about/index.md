# The Curator

## Also Known As

The curator of these terrible entities, the parade-master of this awful alliance and ring-master of this noxious circus is a vaguely human creature known to his inner circle as [Ian Usher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-usher-the-curator).  When not writing in this hammy fashion or questioning whether he's actually grasped exactly what a cavalcade is, he writes software for a living.  While he's very skeptical of the quality of his own work (indeed his impostor syndrome anthropomorphised would make a formidable addition to this monstrous collection) he's quite proud of the curiosities listed within these pages.  He's also quite proud that he managed to put together this site with only a smattering of scorn &amp; laughter from his partner, a graphic designer.

He's hoping that finally having a proper, non-wordpress site after all this time might encourage him to add more content to it and get more projects up and running.  It probably won't, but he enjoys the hope.

## Modus Operandi

You can find out more about the curator's curious existence by:

* looking at his [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-usher-the-curator)
* reading his [Twitter feed](http://www.twitter.com/fatconan) (which he warns is as incomprehensible and unpleasant a feed as any)
* or poring over his [Curriculum Vitae](/the-curator/cv.html) (which is fancy Latin for Mediocre Achievement Documentation)
