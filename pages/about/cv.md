# Ian Usher

I am a resourceful and motivated software engineer with two decades of programming experience in a wide-range of 
development facets, from writing responsive web applications, to building and packaging a variety of helpful libraries, 
to constructing distributed data-processing systems.

I am currently seeking a position in which I may learn new skills and expand my knowledge, while also serving as a 
constructive, diligent and creative member of a team of similarly motivated people. I am looking for a role in which 
I can contribute, not just to the codebase, but also to projects (in terms of design and planning) at large.

{% d.role-highlights 

_Individually designing and building various in-house support software for everyday operations._

My primary focus — a Java application named cpeep for **C**ode**p**lay **E**mploe**e** **P**ortal — grew from a simple 
time sheet & sign-in board app, into a full HR suite incorporating all aspects of employee development and job grade 
evaluation, as well as handling our entire recruitment process. 

Furthermore, it became a platform to which any part of the 
company could turn in order to accommodate functionality designed to bridge gaps, or provide features that third-party
tools were unable to support. These bolt-on pieces of functionality included:

* Providing OAuth authentication for other in-house software platforms
* Supporting an in-office lending library
* Providing easy wake-on-LAN functionality to office desktop machines
* Supporting the collection and categorisation of knowledge sharing video recordings as well as proving a web-based viewer, with attribution to the presenters. 
* Various bespoke, and user-configurable reporting mechanisms for various aspects of the system 
* User-manageable office maps allowing the full editing of floor and room layouts and employee desk allocations within offices
* Integration with Snipe IT to allow users to review their allocated hardware

Parts of the system have been extracted and packaged as stand-alone open-source components under the MIT license.
They are likely all too immature to currently be core components of other, more exposed, platforms, but will be maintained
and improved over time. These components are:

* [DBaser](https://github.com/FatConan/dbaser) - A database wrapper that provides named parameterisation of SQL queries to mitigate injection attacks
* [Formic Acid](https://github.com/FatConan/formic-acid) - Form library that facilitates the construction of HTML forms and the the validation of the data they represent
* [Malic Acid](https://github.com/FatConan/malic-acid) - A Javascript library designed to sit atop Formic Acid to provide more dynamic form interactions and behaviour
* [Staterazor](https://github.com/FatConan/staterazor) - A library that provides flexible state machines as used in some of our esoteric processes

While the bulk of my time was spent working closely with the operations team to develop software to their requirements,
I had a range of other responsibilities from implementing SSO across internal and third party platforms, to planning and 
equipping desks, contributing to help guides, and aiding in security audits.

## Senior Developer
### DeltaDNA
#### July 2011 – June 2016

{% d.role-highlights

_Working in a team to handle data collection from games and provide player insights to video game manufacturers._

As a senior developer I contributed to the development of large parts of the DeltaDNA infrastructure from almost 
its inception. I was heavily involved in the construction of:

* validation and ETL processes for the data collection system
* RESTful data APIs to serve and query aggregated data from DeltaDNA’s warehouses
* notification processing and delivery systems
* the entirety of the publicly accessible administrative application at www.deltadna.net.
* a multitude of helper scripting for everything from collecting up-to-date currency conversion data and ETL-ing IPv4 geo-location data, to scraping and aggregating review data from Steam, Google Play and iTunes.

I was also involved in the design of various aspects of the system, including:

* the REST API for providing aggregated data
* the data collection event format (and validating mechanisms)
* the REST API for collecting data

The demands of the system lead me to working with a wide range of technologies; from cutting edge databases, through 
modern Java/Scala based web application frameworks, to debugging unfamiliar, externally developed, mobile applications.

## Senior Developer
### Mercurytide Ltd
#### January 2005 – July 2011

{% d.role-highlights 

_Building custom web applications for a diverse range of clients._

While at Mercurytide my role was the creation of web applications based on a set of requirements and 
graphical mock-ups. Within that role responsibilities included:

* the gathering of requirements from clients
* the construction of all back-end functionality 
* the design and creation of supporting databases
* the implementation of user interfaces based on provided mock-ups

Applications were written initially in PHP, then migrated to Python and the Django framework (of which we were early 
adopters), and with hand-crafted CSS and Javascript.

## Voight-Kampff
Outside of work I enjoy a good Netflix binge, walking my daft dog, and running the odd game of D&D for friends and 
family. I also like to do a little hobby coding, most of which is in no fit state to be seen, but some of which may 
be encountered on [Github](https://github.com/fatconan/).
