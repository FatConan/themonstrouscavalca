# Ill Conceptions

## The Blog of Eternal Stench

The curator plans to bottle his thoughts and stash them here to be enjoyed by future despots.  Currently the bottles lie empty, clinking against one anther as they rattle their way, by carriage, through the streets.  This is probably how it should stay.

Sadly it inevitably won't.  

And indeed it hasn't.  While waiting for inspiration to strike the curator ended up cobbling together the start of an exploration of 
his failed creations in [The Garderobe](/ill-conceptions/the-garderobe)

*Update* The Curator has started another, more positive, venture. A repository of things he likes to feed to his brain in an effort 
to keep it from deflating. It's a small, but growing, collection over at [Head Will Collapse](//headwillcollapse.net).
