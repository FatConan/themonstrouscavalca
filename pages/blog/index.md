# The Curator

## Also Known As

The curator of these terrible entities, the parade-master of this awful alliance and ring-master of this noxious circus is a vaguely human creature known to his inner circle as Ian.  While not writing in this hammy fashion or questioning whether he's actually grasped exactly what a cavalcade is he writes software for a living.  While he's very skeptical of the quality of his own work (indeed his impostor syndrome anthropomorphised would make a formidable addition to this monstrous collection) he's quite proud of the curiosities listed within these pages.  He's also quite proud that he managed to put together this site with only a smattering of scorn &amp; laughter from his partner, a graphic designer.

"It's vaguely like something I might have designed a decade ago" is high praise for someone whose artisic ability is as low as his.
