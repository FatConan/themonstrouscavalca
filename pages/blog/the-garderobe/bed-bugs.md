# On second-hand books

I like reading on a Kindle; it takes up less space than a book shelf, and no one can see all the embarrassing titles resting on it. It also has the benefit of not 
posing the risk that it's concealing a horde of blood-sucking cimicids within its seams and bindings.  Sure it sounds like a myth: sharks in swimming pools, 
and alligators in sewers, but apparently bed bugs in books is something entirely [real](https://www.bookstr.com/your-book-may-be-infested-with-bedbugs-heres-how-to-tell). 
I for one am more comfortable with pool sharks and sewer gators than that. 

According to my folks Keanu wasn't home to an infestation of insect assailants; oh, and he got the scar on his abdomen from a motorcycle accident.
