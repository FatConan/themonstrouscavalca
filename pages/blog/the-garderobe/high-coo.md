# On the highland cow

Scotland has its own take on cows. Not content with the usual monochrome milk-makers they have down south, Scotland decided it
needed something that fit better with its craggy, desolate wastes.  Enter the highland cow; hairy, horned, prehistoric-looking
beef-barns that strut across the landscape like Banthas of the bleak.

They're impressive hill beasts.

The first time we went north, my partner tried to get some photographs (she failed, but managed to grab some [great photographs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoWgQP2j_a4/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) the last time).

And I wrote this dumb thing.

> The Scottish Haiku<br />Auburn Hair Against White Snow<br />Envy of Low Coo.
