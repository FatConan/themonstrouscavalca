> Where I can get one of those ambitious new e-cigs with the reusable vapour chamber you can recover from its oceanic landing platform?

> Where can I get one of those e-cigs filled with nano-bots that infect your cells &amp; integrate you into a single vaping hive mind?

> Where can I get one of those e-cigs that's strawberry flavoured &amp; has that LED on it that tells you when you're going to be euthanised?

> Where can I get one of those e-cigs that's a full body suit that recycles all bodily waste so you can keep vaping in harsh desert climates?

> Where can I get one of those e-cigs that's like a giant gel-filled pod in which you're forced to breathe the vaporised remains of the dead?

> Does anyone know where I can get an e-cigarette thing that looks like a chrome oboe being orbited by the ships from close encounters?
