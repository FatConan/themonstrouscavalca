# On layman's terms

The third tweet in this series questioned whether I'd stolen this joke from somewhere, but I wasn't able to attribute it
to anyone or anything other than me and my own stupid brain, and there doesn't seem to be anyone else lining up to accept 
responsibility for it.

> I have a friend whose job is to translate things into and out of layman's terms. Half the time I've no idea what they're talking about.

> You'd think it'd be a difficult thing to do, but every time they explain it, it seems pretty straightforward.
