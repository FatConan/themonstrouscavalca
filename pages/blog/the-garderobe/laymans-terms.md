#On layman's terms

The third tweet in this series questioned whether I'd stolen this joke from somewhere, but I wasn't able to attribute it
to anyone or anything other than me and my own stupid brain, and there doesn't seem to be anyone else lining up to accept 
responsibility for it.

Full disclosure: I modified the second tweet to correct a grammatical error.
