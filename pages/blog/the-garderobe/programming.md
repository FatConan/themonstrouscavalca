# On agile development

I don't rewrite many patter songs in my timeline, which is probably for the best, but I really don't think this is a bad fist of
some mock Gilbert &amp; Sullivan. In fact I'd say it's sufficiently good to be easily up there with such reworked greats as that "Love is all around us" cover from 
<em>Love Actually</em>, the Diana version of Candle in the Wind, and that new Tommy Robinson themed version of Hallelujah.

Of course, this rework is about coding, so its subject is far more despicable than anything those other pretenders have to offer.
