# On maverick agents

So you've gone off grid while protecting a fugitive that you believe may have been falsely accused by mole within your own organisation? 
You've already shot a policeman and water-boarded a suspect in a petrol station bathroom? You've stolen a car and driven it halfway across the country?

Have you changed your laptop's wallpaper?

No?

Is it still that blue thing with the shield that looks like one of those ["Winners don't do drugs"](https://twitter.com/SVUFutureDrugs) splash screens you used to get on arcade machines?

It is?

Excellent. Wouldn't want you going too far off the rails.

> Why do TV FBI agents, regardless of how maverick they appear, always slavishly adhere to the organisation's desktop wallpaper policy?<br />

I've been hunting through Google image search because if anyone's going to have a custom desktop it's [Fox Mulder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Mulder).
No luck thus far finding any screen grabs that prove it, but if anyone's copy of Windows 95 is going to have a weed 
smoking Grey with the caption "Take me to your dealer" plastered all over it, it'll be his.
