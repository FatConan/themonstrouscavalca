# DBaser

## Debasing your DBase

A grotesque entity.  **DBaser** was excised from its parent project like a infected organ and repackaged so that might spread its toxic spores to new hosts. It was grown in order to fill that putrid gap between basic *java.sql* functionality and the full blown hideousness of an ORM.
It wraps up a bunch of insidious features into a treacherous package that, having been reinserted into the chest cavity of the unfortunate parent, performs all 
of its daily database interaction.  

Though already hideous, this vivisection of code is still very much a work in progress. It is only an animal, made to stand on two legs and play at civility. 
Should you wish to study it more closely, lift its jar from its pedestal and hold it up to the light you can do so at its [github page](https://github.com/FatConan/dbaser)
