# EIHell

## Devil of the Dice

EIHell has proven to be a mysterious portent of disaster.  It plays dice to determine the likelihood of each of the [EIHL teams](https://eliteleague.co.uk/) reaching the playoffs. Last year, with a predictive accuracy on par with its kin "Paul the Ocotopus", it was able to correctly forewarn of the Capitals' failure.  Also like Paul it has a gelatinous body, can open jars with its tentacles and absolutely the last thing you'd want to share a bath with.

EIHell hasn't yet been informed of the changes for the latest season, the curator is reluctant to climb into it tank and break the news of the Capitals' exit to it. He fears it's gnashing beak; he honestly doesn't know why he graphed that on in the first place.

Should you wish to expose yourself to its probing psychic powers you may do so on its [github page](https://github.com/FatConan/EIHell).

You may also see its previous predictions for the [2017/18 season](http://eihell.themonstrouscavalca.de).
