# Formic Acid
## The Acid Test

Formic Acid is another diseased canker scraped from its parent project. Since being isolated in a petri dish it has grown, sprouting additional limbs and tumours.  Formic Acid's purpose is to wrap a bounty of sickening form validation operations into a dripping bundle that can be used to create arbitrary forms. Perhaps the sort of stomach churning form one might fill out when making an insurance claim or a visa application, for example.

Formic Acid is actively brewing, its warts evident and engorged.  It is planned that this creation will be completed in the near future, and a new experiment begun to stitch it to its sister project [DBaser](/terrible-creations/dbaser). This would potentially create a new abomination offering abilities to validate forms and store their data appropriately.  That being is still some ways off however.
