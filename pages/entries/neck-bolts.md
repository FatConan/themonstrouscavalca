# Neck-Bolts
## An Animated Mishmash

Neck-Bolts is collection of half-formed prototypes and rejected experiments that were cobbled hastily together and thrown into the 
electric-chamber to be animated and evaluated. It is a repository of ideas that may be used, abused, dissected and reassembled to
inspire or aid.

It comes in the shape of some experimental UI components, D3 charts and CSS effects that may be deconstructed and bolted on to your own projects as 
you see fit.

Its rushed components can be found in their primordial form on its [github page](https://github.com/FatConan/neck-bolts), while the shambling, terrifying, and ultimately
tragic creation can be witnessed in motion at [Neck-Bolts](https://neck-bolts.themonstrouscavalca.de).
