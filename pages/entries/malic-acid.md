# Malic Acid
## The Sourest Pill

Malic Aside is the third pustule to burst forth from the same pestilent mother project as [Dbaser](/terrible-creations/dbaser.html) and 
[Formic Acid](/terrible-creations/formic-acid.html). A grotesque twin to Formic Acid, Malic Acid focuses on presenting and processing
horrid HTML forms, rather than validating them. While Formic will determine whether you've filled out your insurance claim correctly, 
it's Malic's job to present you with all of the bewildering inputs and interactions in the first place.  

Should you wish to examine this affront in detail you may do so at its [github page](https://github.com/FatConan/malic-acid)
