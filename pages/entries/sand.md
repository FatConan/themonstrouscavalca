# Sand

## Children of Dune

**Sand** is a static website generator based on [Stone](https://github.com/neuralsandwich/stone) by [NeuralSandwich](https://github.com/neuralsandwich). **Sand**, however, has 
a narrower focus for creating small-scale sites (like this one) with a minimum of configuration. Sand supports wildcards for adding basic pages quickly 
&amp; easily, and allows the specification of output target locations. 

Additionally **Sand** allows access to a collection of useful standard variables to each of the templates as well as offering access to a representation 
of the entire site so that pages can build indices and navigation.  

You may acquire **Sand** for your own purposes at its [Github Repository](https://github.com/fatconan/sand) or read the documentation for an introduction to its usages
at [sand.themonstrouscavalca.de](https://sand.themonstrouscavalca.de).
