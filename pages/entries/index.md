# Terrible Creations

## Don't You Open That Trapdoor
In the dark they lurk. Snapping at one another in the inky blackness with their malformed beaks; groping for throats with their whip-like tendrils. 
Should you wish to unleash them upon the world, you may, but for your own sanity &amp; safety it's strongly, nay vehemently, recommended you leave them to their 
infernal squabbling in the pit. 

* [Podswamp](/terrible-creations/podswamp.html) _&mdash;_ A ghastly tool for creating customisable sites for browsing Libsyn &mdash; the most obnoxious of podcast hosting &mdash; hosted podcasts.
* [Podswamp Examples](/terrible-creations/podswamp.html#todays-putrid-catch) _&mdash;_ From the fetid swamp come the ghouls. Witness a demonstration of the Podswamp's horrific abilities.
* [DBaser](/terrible-creations/dbaser.html) _&mdash;_ A disgusting collection of database tools for the abomination that is Java. It'll help you query your database and scrape whatever gunk is resting there into your Petri dish (metaphorically speaking).
* [Formic Acid](/terrible-creations/formic-acid.html) _&mdash;_ A horde of tools for performing form validation in Java. It may also be layered atop the DBaser project, in a truly heinous strata.
* [Neck-Bolts](/terrible-creations/neck-bolts.html) _&mdash;_ Neck-Bolts is a collection of work-in-progress concepts so called because they might be adequate (at a push) for keeping a head atop a cobbled together corpse, but they are by no means an ideal solution.
* [Sand](/terrible-creations/sand.html) _&mdash;_ The fool built his home upon the rock while the wise man built his house on the Sand.
* [headwillcollapse.net](//headwillcollapse.net) _&mdash;_ A congealment of works that the curator enjoys consuming presented in a manner that attempts to depart from his usual repugnant stylings.
