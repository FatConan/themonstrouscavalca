# Terrible Creations

## Don't You Open That Trapdoor
In the dark they lurk. Snapping at one another in the inky blackness with their malformed beaks; groping for throats with their whip-like tendrils. 
Should you wish to unleash them upon the world, you may, but for your own sanity &amp; safety it's strongly, nay vehemently, recommended you leave them to their 
infernal squabbling in the pit. 

* [Podswamp](/terrible-creations/podswamp.html) &mdash; A ghastly tool for creating customisable sites for browsing Libsyn &mdash; the most obnoxious of podcast hosting &mdash; hosted podcasts.
* [Podswamp Examples](/terrible-creations/podswamp.html#todays-putrid-catch) &mdash; From the fetid swamp come the ghouls. Witness a demonstration of the Podswamp's horrific abilities.
* [DBaser](/terrible-creations/dbaser.html) &mdash; A disgusting collection of database tools for the abomination that is Java. It'll help you query your database and scrape whatever gunk is resting there into your Petri dish (metaphorically speaking).
* [Formic Aside](/terrible-creations/formic-aside.html) &mdash; A horde of tools for performing form validation in Java. It may also be layered atop the DBaser project, in a truly heinous strata.
