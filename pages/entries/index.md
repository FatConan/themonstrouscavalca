# The Monstrous Cavalcade

## Terrible Creations
Over the years the collection of bolted, glued and stitched together from fetid parts has grown into something of a gallery of the curious & defective.  The following corrupted projects are available for you to gaze and point at in bewilderment and horror.

* SPY DB - The database of "Stop Podcasting Yourself" podcast episodes with guest lists.
* DBaser - A collection of database helpers for Java
* Formic Aside - A collection of tools for performing form validation in Java. Can also be layered atop the DBaser project.
* EIHell - EIHL Hockey League Playoff Chance Predictor.
* Podswamp - Libsyn Podcast site creator.
