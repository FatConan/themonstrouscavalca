# The Monstrous Cavalcade
## A Parade of Monstrosities
This parade of monstrosities constitutes the public output of the being known as Fat Conan. Here you'll be able to gaze upon his dodgy creations, and if you're so inclined, take advantage of his dubious works.

Be aware that the abominations found lurking on these pages may be poisonous, dangerous or otherwise unpleasant, and any interaction with them is performed at your own risk. It is perhaps best to leave them in their specimen jars safe in their formaldehyde.

## Terrible Creations
Over the years the collection of [terrible creations](/terrible-creations) bolted, glued and stitched together from fetid parts has grown into something of a gallery of the curious & defective.  The following corrupted projects are available for you to gaze and point at in bewilderment and horror.

* SPY DB - The database of "Stop Podcasting Yourself" podcast episodes with guest lists.
* DBaser - A collection of database helpers for Java
* Formic Aside - A collection of tools for performing form validation in Java. Can also be layered atop the DBaser project.
* EIHell - EIHL Hockey League Playoff Chance Predictor.
* Podswamp - Libsyn Podcast site creator.
