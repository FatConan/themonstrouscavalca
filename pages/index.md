# The Monstrous Cavalcade
## A Parade of Monstrosities
This parade of monstrosities constitutes the public output of the being known only as [the curator](/the-curator). Here you'll be able to gaze upon his grotesque creations and, if so inclined, take advantage of his dubious works.

**Beware!** The abominations found lurking on these pages may be poisonous, rancid or otherwise unpleasant and any interaction with them is performed at your own risk. It is perhaps best to leave them in their specimen jars, safe in their formaldehyde.

## Terrible Creations
Over the years the collection of [terrible creations](/terrible-creations) bolted, glued and stitched together from fetid parts has grown into something of a gallery of the curious & defective.  The following corrupted projects are available for you to stare and point at in bewilderment and horror.

* [Podswamp](/terrible-creations/podswamp.html) &mdash; A ghastly tool for creating customisable sites for browsing Libsyn &mdash; the most obnoxious of podcast hosting &mdash; hosted podcasts.
* [Podswamp Examples](/terrible-creations/podswamp.html#todays-putrid-catch) &mdash; From the fetid swamp come the ghouls. Witness a demonstration of the Podswamp's horrific abilities.
* [DBaser](/terrible-creations/dbaser.html) &mdash; A disgusting collection of database tools for the abomination that is Java. It'll help you query your database and scrape whatever gunk is resting there into your Petri dish (metaphorically speaking).
* [Formic Aside](/terrible-creations/formic-aside.html) &mdash; A horde of tools for performing form validation in Java. It may also be layered atop the DBaser project, in a truly heinous strata.
* [EIHell](/terrible-creations/eihell.html) &mdash; A truly despicable EIHL playoff odds predictor.

## Ill Conceptions
Sometimes thoughts drip from the curator's mind like ooze from a spill pipe. On occasion he takes pleasure in capturing this goo in a specimen jar, and displaying alongside the other horrors in his twisted collection. These sickening examples can be browsed, at the risk of the reader, in the darkened corner of this twisted circus forever known as the [blog](/ill-conceptions). 

Conversely some of the curator's thoughts aren't worthy of collecting and are dumped, by the bucket load, into the void of [twitter](https://twitter.com/fatconan). Some of
those unworthy ideas can be found, amongst other slop and ichor, in [The Garderobe](/ill-conceptions/the-garderobe). 

## Hideous Entities
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fatconan) &mdash; Strange squawking voices can be heard emanating from a bore hole behind the old house. Frequently the curator scribbles down their screeched ramblings and records them here for posterity.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/FatConan) &mdash; The circus tent can only hold so many freakish entities, and the curator's budget can only feed so many mouths, sometimes he has to ship his creations off to storage facilities like this. 

## Diamonds in the Rough
Not everything in the cavalcade is a hideous monstrosity. There are some members that are quite the opposite, in fact, including:

* [Agnieszka](http://jerzewska.pl) &mdash; the curator's wonderful partner &amp;
* [Leeloo](https://www.instagram.com/leeloo.the.foxdog/) &mdash; their trusty hound.
