# The Monstrous Cavalcade
## A Parade of Monstrosities
This parade of monstrosities constitutes the public output of the being known as Fat Conan. Here you'll be able to gaze upon his grotesque creations, and if so inclined, take advantage of his dubious works.

Be aware that the abominations found lurking on these pages may be poisonous, rancid or otherwise unpleasant, and any interaction with them is performed at your own risk. It is perhaps best to leave them in their specimen jars, safe in their formaldehyde.

## Terrible Creations
Over the years the collection of [terrible creations](/terrible-creations) bolted, glued and stitched together from fetid parts has grown into something of a gallery of the curious & defective.  The following corrupted projects are available for you to stare and point at in bewilderment and horror.

* [Podswamp](/terrible-creations/podswamp) &mdash; A ghastly tool for creating customisable sites for browsing Libsyn (the most obnoxious of podcast hosting) hosted podcasts.
* [Podswamp Examples](/terrible-creations/podswamp-examples) &mdash; From the fetid swamp come the ghouls. Witness a demonstration of the Podswamp's horrific abilities.
* [DBaser](/terrible-creations/dbaser) &mdash; A disgusting collection of database tools for the abomination that is Java. It'll help you query your database and scrape whatever gunk is resting there into your Petri dish (metaphorically speaking).
* [Formic Aside](/terrible-creations/formic-aside) &mdash; A horde of tools for performing form validation in Java. It may also be layered atop the DBaser project, in a truly heinous strata.
* [EIHell](/terrible-creations/eihell) &mdash; A truly awful EIHL playoff odds predictor.
